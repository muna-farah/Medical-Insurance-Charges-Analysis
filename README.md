# Medical Insurance Charges Prediction

This project analyzes medical insurance charges to understand which factors influence healthcare costs and builds machine learning models to predict charges based on patient attributes.

## Contents
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis of charges by age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, sex, and region.  
- **Visualizations:** Histograms, boxplots, and pairplots illustrating key relationships.  
- **Predictive Models:** Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor models to predict medical charges.  

## Files
- `Medical Insurance Charges Prediction.ipynb` – The main notebook.  

## Key Findings
- Smoking status, age, and BMI are the strongest predictors of medical charges.  
- Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models outperform Linear Regression in predictive accuracy.  
- Patients who smoke or have higher BMI tend to incur higher medical expenses.  

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Medical Insurance Dataset](https://github.com/stedy/Machine-Learning-with-R-datasets/blob/master/insurance.csv).
